# Hi there I'm fieryhenry

I do hacking and modding stuff with the mobile game The Battle Cats

I mainly work on my save editor: https://github.com/fieryhenry/BCSFE-Python (Will be refactoring soon)

At the moment I'm currently working on an updated modding tool that will make it much easier to create custom content (out by the end of the year hopefully)

After that I plan to make a gui version of the save editor and make a system for script based mods that hook functions and stuff to do basically anything (Probably add to the modding tool)
