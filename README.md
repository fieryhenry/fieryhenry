# Hi there I'm fieryhenry

I do hacking and modding stuff with the mobile game The Battle Cats

My most popular project is my save editor: https://github.com/fieryhenry/BCSFE-Python which I will be refactoring at some point because the current code is terrible

At the moment I'm working on an updated ui modding tool that will make it much easier to create custom content for the game. I've spent an insane amount of time on that and it's still a long way off from completion

After that I plan to make a ui version of the save editor
